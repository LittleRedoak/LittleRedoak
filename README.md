- 👋 Hi, I’m @LittleRedoak, a retired building contractor that is bored to death.
- 👀 I’m interested in programing, web div. and project mgmt (currently Scrum 4 cert.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning css, js, and then python? not sure what I'll do next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any thing people will tororate me ( a newbee ) to "help" with.
- 📫 How to reach me -  littleoak@tutanota.com
- I'm open to any help people are willing to share. I have been dabbling in programing for years, ~ Java, HTML, even Pascel & Fortan way back 100yrs ago.
